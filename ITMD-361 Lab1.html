<h3>LAB 1- Get to Know Me!</h3>
<p>Hello all! I am from Antigua and I am happy to be apart of this course. Some things I like to do are graphic designing and teaching myself new things. 
I do believe that Web developmwent is extremely important and neccessary, this is due to the increased online presence of many companies and individuals alike.
My hope for this class is that I will fully master web design and development as well as have a new found love for the work put into making a website.</p>
